## Learning Experience
Completed over 1-2 weeks, this project sharpened my SQL skills and deepened my understanding of HR data analysis. Special thanks to Mohamed Abdelmawla and the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) for their guidance and support.

I'm excited to explore more data engineering projects and continue growing in this field!
